Web Scraping Trump Lies from NYTimes Using Python

Project Overview

In this project, we perform web scraping using Python to extract meaningful information from a webpage. Specifically, we extract details from the New York Times "Trump’s Lies" article, including:

Date of the lie

Lie statement made by Trump
Explanation of why it's false
Source URL (if available)
Finally, we store the extracted data in a CSV file, which can be used for further analysis.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Requests → Fetch webpage content

BeautifulSoup → Parse and extract HTML elements

Pandas → Store and manipulate extracted data


 Key Learnings from This Project
✅ How to fetch web content using requests
✅ How to parse HTML with BeautifulSoup
✅ How to extract specific elements using find_all(), find(), and contents[]
✅ How to store and export structured data using pandas
✅ How to save results as CSV for analysis

Next Steps / Improvements
🔹 Automate Scraping → Use schedule library to scrape data daily/weekly
🔹 Data Visualization → Use matplotlib or seaborn to analyze patterns
🔹 Web Scraping with Selenium → If websites use JavaScript, use Selenium instead of BeautifulSoup
